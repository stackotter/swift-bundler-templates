# Contributing

If you have a bug-fix, improvement or a new template that you think other people will find useful, feel free to open a PR! Just make sure you follow the guidelines outlined below.

## Guidelines

1. All templates should use 4 space indentation
2. Make sure that your changes don't break anything

That's all, making templates is pretty simple!

## Creating a new template

First, read the basic overview of templates in the readme. If you still have some questions, see if reading through the existing templates helps. If you are still confused, open an issue and I'll try to respond relatively quickly.
